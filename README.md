# Live Fitting
This is a project meant as a submission to **Manifeste**.\
We have all worked on Regression.\
Polynomial Regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the **feature** x and **label** y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.\
In the Poly_UI.html file, we can observe Polynomial regression on equation y= ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e. Finally, Output Line is trying to fit the direction of least error.\
Best fitting can be seen at **Learning rate=0.1** , acting as a scaling factor.
It can be used for beginners to visualize ML, since its all about fitting the curve! 

# Tech stack 
-Basic HTML and JS\
-Tensorflow.js\
-P5.js

# How to Use
-Just download this Library and run the Poly_UI.html file.\
-Use your mouse to make data points by dragging and the curve will try to align itself to fit itself in the best possible way!\
-Usually we try to fit the best possible line, here we can observe how line will fit itself.\
-The speed of processing can be seen by varying the learning rate.
