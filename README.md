# Live Fitting
This is just a repo meant as a submission to **Manifeste**.\
We have all worked on Regression.\
Polynomial Regression is a form of linear regression in which the relationship between the **feature** x and **label** y is modeled as an nth degree polynomial.\
In the Poly_UI.html file, we can observe Polynomial regression on equation y= ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e. Finally, Output Line is trying to fit the direction of least error.\
Best fitting can be seen at **Learning rate=0.1** , acting as a scaling factor.\

It can be used for beginners to visualize ML, since its all about fitting the curve!\
